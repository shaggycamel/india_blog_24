    "text": "It was India independence day! The streets were extremely quiet, very few shops were open and very few people were out and about. The expulsion of the British is definitely a cause to celebrate, can New Zealand hurry up and withdraw from the Commonwealth? - Our flight from Delhi to Srinagar was at 1:30pm, we took a taxi to the airport at 10.30am. It took a while to move through the airport, the concept of queuing doesn’t really exist.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe landed in Srinagar after a smooth flight and was greeted by a driver who took us to our hotel. The hotel had been organised by our tour guide (we have a tour guide for the hike). BOOF! - We traipsed into a five-star hotel, marble floor and impressive decor, greeted by an overly smiley doorman and about nine people at reception all bobbling their heads, grinning and saying “Hello Sir, hello Madam. How are you?”, they all gestured towards the couches and insisted we take a seat and have a tea. They then hovered around ensuring our comfort. FUCKKK, it was overwhelming! We looked like hobos, wearing hiking boots, hauling backpacks and wearing slimy clothes sweaty from the Delhi humidity. We all felt uncomfortable.\nWe took the stairs, much to our hosts despair and protest to use the elevator, unpacked in our plush rooms and went for a walk around the local streets. We stopped for dinner and ate delicious Aloo Mutter (potato & pea curry) & Daal for dinner.\n\nWander\nOn our first night at the five-star freak show Trav was sick, awaking in the night to vomit and diarrhea. Poor guy. Maybe it was the KFC we had at the airport yesterday. I vowed to stick to vegetarian food for the rest of the trip. It’s the Indian attempt at Western food, that’s what gets ya. Mum, Dad & I had breakfast at the Hotel and discussed the possibility of vacating to simpler accommodation. After breakfast, Dad & I crossed the road, found a place and inquired. Too easy! We packed our bags, paid the exorbitant price and said au-revoir, the new place felt much more comfortable. People didn’t hover around you like flies to shit.\nWith Trav being out for the day, Mum, Dad & I decided to just wander the streets. Mum was eager to find a rug for Lila’s bedroom, Lila is our new family member, Renee had a daughter a few days before the India trip. After a decent foot-tour of the surrounding area, we stumbled into a carpet store and had a nosey. There was some really cool rugs, if I owned a house I would definitely have bought one.\nAfterwards, we continued exploring the area making our way home around 4pm.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWander\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWander\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWander\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWander\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWander\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWander\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevoius\n\n\n\nNext\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPather Masjid\nWe picked up Trav, who had spent the day resting, and aimed to visit the large Mosque, aptly named Jama Masjid - the same name as the Delhi Mosque. It was a decent walk away, so we set off. Trav wasn’t feeling well, so we took it slow. We never actually made it to Jama Masjid, instead, we wound up at a Mosque called Pather Masjid. It is a stone Mosque that was erected in the 1500s, it was stunnig! It was quite blocky and gave off Roman/Greek vibes but the curvy patterns carved into the stone was definitely Islamic. Families were relaxing outside, we took a few photos with them, sending them via WhatsApp the following day.\nTrav started to fade, so we set off home, taking a tuktuk instead of walking this time. Trav left for the hotel, Mum, Dad & I went for dinner. We found a lovely vegetarian family restaurant, which means a place where more than just men are welcome, I think.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPather Masjid\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPather Masjid\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPather Masjid\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPather Masjid\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPather Masjid\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevoius\n\n\n\nNext\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHari Parbat Fort\nIn the middle of the night, Tundip, the man organising our trek, arrived at our hotel. We met in the morning and had a laugh, he’s a jovial, cheeky man from the very north of India (by Tibet). He will drive us to Kargil tomorrow, but we organised a day of sightseeing together in Srinagar. We decided to see Hari Parbat (fort), Jama Masjid and a Shikara boat ride on Dal Lake.\nBecause there was now five of us, we took two tuktuks to Hari Parbat Fort, it was quite a while away, perched atop the highest point in town. It was heavily guarded by military, we walked a kilometre or so up the hill from the carpark to the fort. It had the most spectacular views of the city, surrounding mountains and scattered lakes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHari Parbat\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHari Parbat\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHari Parbat\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHari Parbat\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHari Parbat\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHari Parbat\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevoius\n\n\n\nNext\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDal Lake - Shikara\nWe left the fort by tuktuk and stopped for lunch. Mum and Dad wanted to visit a carpet store before it closed at 7pm, so we discussed culling Jama Masjid from our plan and doing just the Shikara instead. We’ve seen enough Mosque’s anyway.\nA Shikara is a slim boat that was originally used to transport people and goods to and from house boats that used to be anchored in the middle of the lake. The house boats were in the middle because the British weren’t allowed to own land in Kashmir during their occupation of India. Now that they’re gone (good riddens), the house boats line the shores.\nThe Shikara was a nice meandering float in Dal Lake for just over an hour. We passed lots of other Indian tourists having the same Shikara experience. Touts rowed up to us and attempted to sell coffee, tea, watches, egg timers, bongs, hookah, the usual nik-naks. It was a nice experience, the house boats are quite incredible. Afterwards we walked back to the hotel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDal Lake\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDal Lake\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDal Lake\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDal Lake\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDal Lake\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDal Lake\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDal Lake\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDal Lake\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDal Lake\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDal Lake\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevoius\n\n\n\nNext\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThoughts & Feelings\nThe pace at Srinagar is much slower than Delhi. People don’t pester you as much, they still approach, but accept “No” far more easily. The temperature was pleasant, sitting around 29 degrees with far less humidity than Delhi. It rained a lot, which maintained the cool feeling. One morning had thunder and lightning for hours which was really cool.\nThe main religion here is Islam, and honestly, I find Islam produces people who are a bit more genuine than Hinduism. There is less scramble for the top, and less emphasis on the caste system, which dictates a lot how India operates and how Indians treat one another.\nTomorrow we leave for Kargil, leaving at 5am and driving over the Zojila pass. We have just one night there as a stopover on our way to Leh.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMisc\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMisc\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMisc\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMisc\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMisc\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMisc\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMisc\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMisc\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevoius\n\n\n\nNext"

    "text": "We departed from Srinagar in a car organised by our tour guide at 5am, set for Kargil. It will be just a quick stopover there, consisting of one night. The drive took 9 hours to travel around 250km. We stopped for meals and photos along the way, which probably extended the duration longer than necessary.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKargil is a small Muslim town sandwiched between the Suru River and a picturesque mountain backdrop. We have entered Himalayan territory, so every view is complemented with breathtaking mountain vistas.\n\nZoji La (pass)\nIn the first few hours of the drive, we drove over the Zoji La (La means pass). This was our first encounter with altitude. Luckily we were passengers in the vehicle, I wouldn’t want to be behind the wheel of a car experiencing a headache and clumsiness brought on by high altitude.\nThe Zoji La is the second-highest pass in the Zanskar region at around 3500 metres. It was cold at the top, and I was happy to have worn a jacket and had a sweatshirt handy. Warm clothes went against intuition because Srinagar was relatively warm.\nWe got out to take photos, my feet felt twice as heavy as normal. Signs from the Border Roads Organisation (BRO) were scattered all over the place with rather funny anecdotes, like: “Drinking Whisky? - Driving Risky”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nZoji La\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nZoji La\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nZoji La\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nZoji La\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nZoji La\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nZoji La\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nZoji La\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevoius\n\n\n\nNext\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWander\nThe small town of Kargil is really cute. There is just one main road and residents are constantly out there going about their business. I’m not sure of the population, but with the amount of people visible, it feels much larger than it probably is. We ate dinner at a restaurant that had an enlarged photograph of a mountain. Trav mentioned that it bore a striking resemblance to Aoraki. We asked the restaurant guys where it was taken, they said it was an edited photograph, and every component of it was fabricated. Trav, not being able to put it to rest, found the exact photo online, and sure enough, it was of Aoraki. How funny? To find a large photo of Aoraki on a wall of a restaurant in a little village in the Himalayan ranges.\nWe stayed in a wonderful hotel with spectacular views of the mountain ranges. Although, a Masjid (mosque) was directly next door, so the call to prayer boomed through our windows at 4.30am. Usually, I like the call to prayer, it has such a pleasant ambience, however, on this particular occasion it was so loud and early in the morning that it was annoying.\nOur programme of altitude sickness pills was started here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWander\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWander\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWander\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWander\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWander\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWander\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevoius\n\n\n\nNext\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThoughts & Feelings\nKargil is a quaint little town, people are friendly and genuine. Not once did we feel pressured to purchase anything or were followed by beggars or touts. Most just wanted to stop and say hello.\nSome interesting signs exclaiming to boycott Israeli products and openly stating that Israeli people were not welcome in Kargil, could be seen dotted around the main street. The Islamic community really have rallied against the Israelis and the war waged against Palestine. I get it, but your everyday Israeli has no control over what their government does. Most probably disagree with it completely. I haven’t met enough Israelis to formulate a proper opinion, but, given the benefit of the doubt, most Israelis probably aren’t that bad. Are they?\nTomorrow we drive eight hours to Leh, in the same car with the same driver: a 23-year-old Zanskari boy named Tansing, he’s quite shy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMisc\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMisc\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMisc\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMisc\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMisc\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevoius\n\n\n\nNext"

    "text": "Excursion\nI’m writing this one week out from my flight to Delhi.\nMy bag is packed, although, there is a 100% chance that I will repack it throughout the week, just to reassure myself that nothing is forgotten. I still need to buy some underwear, as I’ve recently cleaned out my wardrobe and thrown away raggy/holey clothes.\nIt’s an interesting day today. Today, the 3rd of August, is my sister’s birthday. However, what’s also happening today is my sister is going into labour and will have a baby girl. In the next day or so, I will be an uncle for the first time, a strange feeling resides within me right now.\nThe trip to India is mainly taking place because of my brother. My parents, being the wonderful hippies that they are, have given each one of their children an experience hiking through the Himalayas as a birthday present. My experience was gifted to me when I was 21, in 2012. Back then, I travelled to India with my parents and ventured on a three week expedition through the Zanskar region. This time around we, my parents, brother and I, will do a two week expedition hiking from Zingchem to Zangla, a different valley in the Zansakar region, within the Hemis National Park.\n\n\nFeeling\nBeing “excited” for the trip is an understatement. I’m ecstatic! I can’t wait to be thrown into the midst of uncertainty and chaos. Overloading my senses with strange and new sounds, sights and smells is an addiction. Last year I travelled through Northern Africa and relished in the chaos. My memory of being 21 in India was slightly different. I was probably less confident and comfortable integrating with the crazyness, nevertheless, I loved the trip, and I’m looking forward to seeing how much India has progressed since I was last there.\nIt always interests me to hear the Western world describe “developing” countries as “progressing”. Because, in many ways, I think these countries are already far more progressive than their Western counterparts. The lifestyle within these countries is far more focused on the establishment of relationships. Be that a relationship with family or friends, or a relationship with local small businesses like grocers and butchers. Everything revolves around this structure, which gives life to organic interactions and a stronger feeling of belonging. The only “developing” aspect of these countries is the infrastructure, and by that I mean physical infrastructure, because the digital infrastructure is usually far more agile and advanced than that of New Zealand, for example.\nSo, when I hear someone, particularly as Westerner, describe a country as “developing”, I often wonder if they have thought deeply about that sentiment.\n\n\nWrap Up\nI hope you, whoever you are, follow along with my journey. These are diary entries, meaning I capture whatever thought flows through my mind at the time of writing, with no filter. Other posts will contain photos and descriptions as well."

    "text": "After an early breakfast and our first altitude pill we set off for Leh by car.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was going to take about six hours to travel 250km. It’s slow going because we literally are navigating through the Himalayas and roads are pretty rough. There were a few things we wanted to see on the way, such as a Buddhist Monastery, a Baltistani Fort and the Buddhist town of Lama Yuru. The drive took us more like eight hours because we stopped for lots of photos and exploration on the way, we were all quite tired after arriving in Leh.\n\nDrive: Kargil to Leh\n\nMonastery\nAfter a few hours we stopped, I’ve forgotten the name of the village, it was very small. A large ancient Buddha had been carved into rock by Monks, probably around 400AD. It was quite a stunning sight to behold, as the carving loomed over you, I felt quite small standing underneath it. I was fascinated watching the Buddhists get down on their knees and prey underneath it.\nWithin the same village, but a short 10-minute drive up a hill on an unpaved road, stood a Buddhist Monastery. We visited it expecting to go inside, but no one was there, so we wandered around the outside, taking in the amazing views of the valley. I felt rather puffed and heavy from the altitude, at one stage I actually doubted whether I could ascend the stairs, which was not a feeling I’d ever felt before.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMonastery\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMonastery\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMonastery\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMonastery\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMonastery\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevoius\n\n\n\nNext\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFort\nAfter the Monastery, we continued driving until we came to a turn-off to a village called Chiktan. It’s a tiny village with 3/4 houses of devout Muslims. The roads are well-paved and signage from Iranian political leaders is plastered throughout the main street. It appears this town has accepted money/investment from the Iranian government. Much the same way NZ invests in Pacific Island infrastructure, I guess. The Fort, a dilapidated structure from the Baltistan era (600 AD), was perched halfway up a gravel stone hill at the end of the village. We hiked up, again the altitude made my legs feel like lead and I had an annoying headache making the frontal lobe of my brain feel hazy. There were two crumbling structures, Mum and I stopped at the first one and watched Dad and Trav hike further up the hill to the second.\nComing down and getting into the car, we were receiving strange looks from the locals. I got the feeling locals weren’t really welcome here, so we got out of the pretty quick. We didn’t feel unsafe, rather, encroaching on their private, farming, religious lifestyles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFort\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFort\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFort\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFort\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFort\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFort\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevoius\n\n\n\nNext\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLama Yuru\nOur final stop was Lama Yuru, a Buddhist town with a massive monastery, Monks from all over the Himalayas come here, it’s quite amazing to see. I’ve actually been here before, back when I hiked through the Zanskar region with my parents in 2012 (12 years ago). The town is built on a hill and the gradient of the roads reminds me of Wellington.\nWe didn’t go into the Monastery because it had been an arduous day and we still had a few hours drive left to Leh, so we didn’t want to spend too long here. Instead of going into the Monastery, we walked around the base of it, taking photos of the amazing views beholden to us.\nI strongly remember Lama Yuru back when I was 21, it was the final destination of our three-week hike. And we celebrated by drinking Godfather beer (a high-percentage Indian brew). Mum, Dad & I have seen the interior of the Monastery before, so we didn’t feel like we were missing too much this time around. Trav felt indifferent about it, as far as I could tell.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLama Yuru\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLama Yuru\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLama Yuru\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLama Yuru\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLama Yuru\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevoius\n\n\n\nNext\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeh\nWe arrived in Leh, which is the largest city in Ladakh with a population of around 130,000 and sits at an altitude of 3500 metres. There is a large military presence here. Again, I’ve been here before 12 years ago, but it has changed dramatically! Many more tourists are here, the street configuration has changed and the main market is not where it used to be. We spent three nights here, and spent most of our time relaxing and shopping, on our last full day we hiked to a Fort / Monastery poised at the top of a hill near the main centre. The food in Leh is unique, with the main influence coming from Tibet. It was really nice not eating Talhi, Dall and Curry, and instead having Momo (dumpling) or Noodle/Pasta Soup. We also met with our tour guide here and organised details pertaining to our upcoming hike.\n\nWander & Shopping\nThe markets in Leh are such wonderful workshops for locals. Negotiation, barter, deception, networking, wins & losses take place here. As well as the dedicated markets (there are pockets of them all over the city), the streets are lined with dedicated shops that sell much the same goods and products as the markets. The types of things one can buy here are Tibetan jewellery (usually laden with Turquoise), Yak/Pashmina wool products (scarves, shawls, clothing, etc…), all types of clothing, hardware like farming tools, pretty much anything.\nThe selection of mountaineering clothing for sale is in abundance here, I believe outdoor pursuits are the reason most tourists come here. So, I purchased myself a really nice pair of hiking pants for 1500 rupees ($30 NZD). I also got myself a black corduroy shirt I can wear in casual situations back home, and some jewellery for loved ones. Trav got the purchase of the stay I think, that being a pashmina wool robe that looks like something you can trounce around the house in when working from home. I want one for myself actually, it looks extremely comfortable and warm.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWander\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWander\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWander\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWander\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWander\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWander\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWander\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWander\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevoius\n\n\n\nNext\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFort / Monastery\nIn the morning we convened in the office of our tour guide, it’s a cute one-room office on the outskirts, within walking distance of town, to pick up some permits and discuss the hike a bit more. Afterwards, we continued walking away from town towards the Monastery atop the hill. The walk took about thirty minutes and wasn’t too strenuous but the restriction of blood flow through the body due to altitude was apparent.\nViews from the Monastery allowed one to see the entire city of Leh, we also watched two Army fighter jets cruise and do laps around nearby mountain ranges. It was really loud but fascinating to watch.\nWe then walked down the opposite side of the hill to the fort. We didn’t go inside because it cost 300 rupees, which isn’t too much, but forts aren’t something that greatly interests us. Regardless, it’s quite a big structure and would’ve been a formidable form of defence in the past.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeh Fort Monastery\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeh Fort Monastery\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeh Fort Monastery\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeh Fort Monastery\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeh Fort Monastery\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeh Fort Monastery\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeh Fort Monastery\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeh Fort Monastery\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeh Fort Monastery\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeh Fort Monastery\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeh Fort Monastery\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeh Fort Monastery\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeh Fort Monastery\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeh Fort Monastery\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeh Fort Monastery\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeh Fort Monastery\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeh Fort Monastery\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeh Fort Monastery\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeh Fort Monastery\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeh Fort Monastery\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevoius\n\n\n\nNext\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThoughts & Feelings\nLeh is a really cool city. I actually looked for Data Analyst jobs available, on the off chance that I could live and work here. There were none, haha. I guess the main industry is tourism, in fact, I didn’t see any businesses that weren’t relevant to tourism in some way (like Banks or Insurance firms).\nIt’s interesting to see the progression and development of a place over such a short time span (12 years). The change is dramatic and makes me wonder why the pace of development in New Zealand is so slow.\nTomorrow we leave for a remote village called Turtuk by car, which is about 8 hours. And we’ll pass over the Rotung La, the second-highest navigable pass in the world. After two nights in Turtuk and one in Disket, we return to Leh, which I’m looking forward to. For some reason Leh feels like a place to hunker down; it’s easygoing, low pressure, people are nice, the food is good, more expensive than Delhi but relatively cheap in the grand scheme of things, the air is fresh and amazing views are bountiful.\nWhen we return I plan on getting a shave from a barber.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMisc\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMisc\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMisc\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMisc\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevoius\n\n\n\nNext"

    "text": "After a twenty hour excursion consisting of two flights and five hour layover in Singapore we touched down in Delhi. I had met Trav (brother) and Mum & Dad at Singapore, where we all had flown from our respective origins. The flights went smoothly, with no delays, cancellations or lost bags. A stark contrast to the usual error riddled modern aviation experience. Singapore Airlines ❤️\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMum & Dad being seasoned travellers, with an expertise travelling specifically in India, had planned most of our six week journey which included pickups from airports. Standing in the Delhi humidity at 7am amongst persistent taxi drivers searching for our driver described to be holding a sign that said “Lal’s Havelli: Eaton” was surprisingly easy. Lal’s Havelli being the name of our accommodation in Pahar Ganj, Delhi. Many dogs, who looked well fed and somewhat healthy/friendly slept on the walkway to the carpark. Our bags were tied to the roof of the car and we set off to the hotel. On the way, we pulled over to cover our bags with a tarpaulin to stave off unpredictable monsoon rains.\nThe hotel was modest. It is built on a lean so climbing the steps and navigating the floors feel like you’re on a deep-sea vessel, or drunk, or both. It’s not a fancy jaunt, but has served well as Mum & Dad’s base into India for decades. After reconvening over chai on the rooftop, we put together a three-day sightseeing plan for Delhi, which consisted of: relax today, Jama Masjid Mosque & Chandni Chowk market tomorrow and Akshardham Mandir (temple) & Connaught Place the following day.\nPahar Ganj is a bustling diverse suburb consisting of local residential areas, small manufacturing (like furniture), restaurants, beggars, middle class wealth and low class poverty. It’s where most back-packers wind up because of the affordable accommodation, food, clothing and products. You can literally find anything here.\n\nJama Masjid\nJama Masjid is a muslim mosque. I visited a lot of mosques last year, so kinda knew what I was in for, and was excited to breathe the devout air that shrouds any mosque. After paratha for breakfast, we snagged a four seater tuktuk for a twenty/thirty minute journey there. It was a simple mosque, but all of them are visually beautiful in their own right, and are cared for by volunteers. We wore pants to cover our knees and ankles. It cost 300 for entry, an extra 50 for mum (all women) for shawl hire, which covers any skin on the neck/face. This was a bit extreme I thought, and was probably just a money grab from the mosque. Shoes had to be removed for entry, and touts tried to flick off slippers for 100, bare feet was fine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJama Masjid\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJama Masjid\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJama Masjid\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJama Masjid\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJama Masjid\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJama Masjid\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJama Masjid\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJama Masjid\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJama Masjid\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJama Masjid\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJama Masjid\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJama Masjid\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJama Masjid\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevoius\n\n\n\nNext\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChandni Chowk\nThe afternoon sun was much more apparent after the mosque, I was sweating and red in the face. A large market area called Chandni Chowk surrounds the mosque. We aimed to make our way towards the clothing area, bypassing the spice market on the way. We followed our noses, which led us through the tools and engineering sector. It was funny to see things like push-lawnmowers and PPE for sale. I can’t imagine the typical Delhi family owning a lawn to tend, and I have yet to see any road workers or labourers wear PPE, let alone covered shoes. It was cute to see small shops selling just one product, probably specialising in it. For example, glue. I entered a glue store asking for super-glue. I need to fix a loose clip on my camera strap. They asked what I needed to glue, I showed them, and we fixed it in the store at no cost. After walking for a while in the industrial area, we realised we were lost. We reconvened and hailed a tuktuk to the spice sector. We arrived. It was chaos! Horns, shouts, cows, traffic at a standstill. Pandemonium. Wandering through the spice was akin to dosing mushrooms. So many colours, smells, people yelling at you, a slight feeling of discomfort but an eager curiosity to be there, to be present in the experience. We stopped for lunch, I can’t remember exactly what we had but it was delicious nonetheless.\nOnwards, to the clothing section. Chaos followed us, or did it spread and we followed it? Kids were running around everywhere, I kept a close eye on my pockets and bag, even moving it to the front of my body to sway pick-pockets. I got some work socks and a nice button up shirt for casual occasions. The main type of garb in the clothing section was woman’s bridal dresses. We all started to fade after a long day in the heat, so we got a tuktuk home. The traffic was bumper to bumper for most the way home, peak traffic! - It was nuts, actually.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChandni Chowk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChandni Chowk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChandni Chowk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChandni Chowk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChandni Chowk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChandni Chowk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChandni Chowk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChandni Chowk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChandni Chowk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChandni Chowk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChandni Chowk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChandni Chowk\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevoius\n\n\n\nNext\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAkshardham Mandir\nAkshardham Mandir is a Hindu temple. After searching for a place to have omelette for breakfast - we vied for something less heavy than southern curry to start the day - we took the metro to the temple. To the metro was busy, pick-pocket territory, I removed everything from my pockets and stored my bag on the front of my body. It was hot walking from the metro to the temple. Security at the temple was insane! First a bag scan for drones, second a declaration of all electronic items including smart watch, phones, camera which had to be remain in your bag and your stored away. Thirdly, a full body scan, pat down and thorough search of pockets. I’m not sure why security was so tight, I have a feeling it has something to do with Hindu nationalism and a disdain for Muslims. But, I’m not exactly sure! Anyway, the temple was stunning! Intricate hard carved walls of sandstone lined the premise, which told a story of Srinirayan Akshardham (a Jesus like figure) and the Hindu journey. Walking the black and white tiles towards the temple drew quite a spectacular view. It’s a shame photography wasn’t allowed. We removed our shoes to enter. Hindu’s were on their knees, some even their stomachs, praying to the idol in the middle. Each load bearing pole resembled a totem with detailed carvings. We walked the interior walls reading and learning about Hinduism. It sounds a bit culty, in my opinion. Regardless, I admire the care for all livings that is embraced within the religion (hence vegetarianism).\nDad was starting to fade from the heat. We coaxed him into walking the base of the temple, where hundreds of elephants were hand carved into the sandstone. We made it, and hurried to find a place for a cold drink before Dad completely melted. The coke was over-priced, but we felt much better afterwards.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAkshardham Mandir\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAkshardham Mandir\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevoius\n\n\n\nNext\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConnaught Place\nAfter Akshardham, we took the metro to Connaught Place. This is the CBD of Delhi, it is of a much different demographic to Pahar Ganj. This is where middle/upper class Indian’s hangout, this is where banks and shopping outlets are. It’s quite a nice design, with a large patch of circular grass in the centre and shopping around it. However, we felt uncomfortable here. Scammers were rife, and came across as educated and for more elaborate than Pahar Ganj scammers. Regardless, they still shared the same persistent, annoying behaviour, the same barrage of words, trying their best to rid you of sensible thought in order to obtain your money in some way or another. Food was priced far beyond our range here, although we found some cheap pastries and hightailed it out of here.\nTrav found a tourist attraction on the map, which was an old, ancient step well. We walked there, it was a beautiful sight, and would have been the beating heart of this area in its heyday (before capitalism). We got two tuktuks home because they wouldn’t allow four of us in one tuktuk. I think this was a decision more for our money, than our safety.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConnaught Place\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevoius\n\n\n\nNext\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThoughts & Feelings\nIndia has changed since I last was here. I remember stopping to drink coke from glass bottles and returning them to the vendor once done, now all drinks are tin cans. There are less beggars and standard of living has generally improved across all facets of life. WiFi is abundant, I remember only accessing internet from internet cafes. Tuktuks are now electric vehicles. Men hold hands less, I vividly remember grown men holding hands to signify friendship, that doesn’t happen anymore. And, there is far less cigarette smoking! In fact, I have seen very few people smoking compared to almost every male a decade ago. What hasn’t changed is the constant sales pitch and drive to deliver you Western comfort. I didn’t come to India to experience western things, I don’t want to be comfortable. Instead, I want to feel uncertain, I want to feel out-of-depth and I want to experience things and be stimulated in ways that I cannot back home. It’s a shame that I cut so many people off from conversation because I’m afraid of being scammed. These people may be genuine, but I would rather not take the risk. It’s sad.\nWhat’s funny is, I experienced feelings of “home” after a few hours in Delhi. It makes me wonder, is home really a place, or is home more closely associated with feeling? And, why does my feeling of home differ drastically from the status quo?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMisc\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMisc\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMisc\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMisc\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMisc\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMisc\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMisc\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMisc\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMisc\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMisc\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMisc\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMisc\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMisc\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMisc\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMisc\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevoius\n\n\n\nNext"
