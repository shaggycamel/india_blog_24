    "text": "It was India independence day! The streets were extremely quiet, very few shops were open and very few people were out and about. The expulsion of the British is definitely a cause to celebrate, can New Zealand hurry up and withdraw from the Commonwealth? - Our flight from Delhi to Srinagar was at 1:30pm, we took a taxi to the airport at 10.30am. It took a while to move through the airport, the concept of queuing doesn’t really exist.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe landed in Srinagar after a smooth flight and was greeted by a driver who took us to our hotel. The hotel had been organised by our tour guide (we have a tour guide for the hike). BOOF! - We traipsed into a five-star hotel, marble floor and impressive decor, greeted by an overly smiley doorman and about nine people at reception all bobbling their heads, grinning and saying “Hello Sir, hello Madam. How are you?”, they all gestured towards the couches and insisted we take a seat and have a tea. They then hovered around ensuring our comfort. FUCKKK, it was overwhelming! We looked like hobos, wearing hiking boots, hauling backpacks and wearing slimy clothes sweaty from the Delhi humidity. We all felt uncomfortable.\nWe took the stairs, much to our hosts despair and protest to use the elevator, unpacked in our plush rooms and went for a walk around the local streets. We stopped for dinner and ate delicious Aloo Mutter (potato & pea curry) & Daal for dinner.\n\nWander\nOn our first night at the five-star freak show Trav was sick, awaking in the night to vomit and diarrhea. Poor guy. Maybe it was the KFC we had at the airport yesterday. I vowed to stick to vegetarian food for the rest of the trip. It’s the Indian attempt at Western food, that’s what gets ya. Mum, Dad & I had breakfast at the Hotel and discussed the possibility of vacating to simpler accommodation. After breakfast, Dad & I crossed the road, found a place and inquired. Too easy! We packed our bags, paid the exorbitant price and said au-revoir, the new place felt much more comfortable. People didn’t hover around you like flies to shit.\nWith Trav being out for the day, Mum, Dad & I decided to just wander the streets. Mum was eager to find a rug for Lila’s bedroom, Lila is our new family member, Renee had a daughter a few days before the India trip. After a decent foot-tour of the surrounding area, we stumbled into a carpet store and had a nosey. There was some really cool rugs, if I owned a house I would definitely have bought one.\nAfterwards, we continued exploring the area making our way home around 4pm.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWander\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWander\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWander\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWander\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWander\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWander\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevoius\n\n\n\nNext\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPather Masjid\nWe picked up Trav, who had spent the day resting, and aimed to visit the large Mosque, aptly named Jama Masjid - the same name as the Delhi Mosque. It was a decent walk away, so we set off. Trav wasn’t feeling well, so we took it slow. We never actually made it to Jama Masjid, instead, we wound up at a Mosque called Pather Masjid. It is a stone Mosque that was erected in the 1500s, it was stunnig! It was quite blocky and gave off Roman/Greek vibes but the curvy patterns carved into the stone was definitely Islamic. Families were relaxing outside, we took a few photos with them, sending them via WhatsApp the following day.\nTrav started to fade, so we set off home, taking a tuktuk instead of walking this time. Trav left for the hotel, Mum, Dad & I went for dinner. We found a lovely vegetarian family restaurant, which means a place where more than just men are welcome, I think.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPather Masjid\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPather Masjid\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPather Masjid\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPather Masjid\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPather Masjid\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevoius\n\n\n\nNext\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHari Parbat Fort\nIn the middle of the night, Tundip, the man organising our trek, arrived at our hotel. We met in the morning and had a laugh, he’s a jovial, cheeky man from the very north of India (by Tibet). He will drive us to Kargil tomorrow, but we organised a day of sightseeing together in Srinagar. We decided to see Hari Parbat (fort), Jama Masjid and a Shikara boat ride on Dal Lake.\nBecause there was now five of us, we took two tuktuks to Hari Parbat Fort, it was quite a while away, perched atop the highest point in town. It was heavily guarded by military, we walked a kilometre or so up the hill from the carpark to the fort. It had the most spectacular views of the city, surrounding mountains and scattered lakes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHari Parbat\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHari Parbat\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHari Parbat\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHari Parbat\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHari Parbat\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHari Parbat\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevoius\n\n\n\nNext\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDal Lake - Shikara\nWe left the fort by tuktuk and stopped for lunch. Mum and Dad wanted to visit a carpet store before it closed at 7pm, so we discussed culling Jama Masjid from our plan and doing just the Shikara instead. We’ve seen enough Mosque’s anyway.\nA Shikara is a slim boat that was originally used to transport people and goods to and from house boats that used to be anchored in the middle of the lake. The house boats were in the middle because the British weren’t allowed to own land in Kashmir during their occupation of India. Now that they’re gone (good riddens), the house boats line the shores.\nThe Shikara was a nice meandering float in Dal Lake for just over an hour. We passed lots of other Indian tourists having the same Shikara experience. Touts rowed up to us and attempted to sell coffee, tea, watches, egg timers, bongs, hookah, the usual nik-naks. It was a nice experience, the house boats are quite incredible. Afterwards we walked back to the hotel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDal Lake\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDal Lake\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDal Lake\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDal Lake\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDal Lake\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDal Lake\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDal Lake\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDal Lake\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDal Lake\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDal Lake\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevoius\n\n\n\nNext\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThoughts & Feelings\nThe pace at Srinagar is much slower than Delhi. People don’t pester you as much, they still approach, but accept “No” far more easily. The temperature was pleasant, sitting around 29 degrees with far less humidity than Delhi. It rained a lot, which maintained the cool feeling. One morning had thunder and lightning for hours which was really cool.\nThe main religion here is Islam, and honestly, I find Islam produces people who are a bit more genuine than Hinduism. There is less scramble for the top, and less emphasis on the caste system, which dictates a lot how India operates and how Indians treat one another.\nTomorrow we leave for Kargil, leaving at 5am and driving over the Zojila pass. We have just one night there as a stopover on our way to Leh.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMisc\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMisc\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMisc\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMisc\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMisc\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMisc\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMisc\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMisc\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevoius\n\n\n\nNext"

    "text": "Excursion\nI’m writing this one week out from my flight to Delhi.\nMy bag is packed, although, there is a 100% chance that I will repack it throughout the week, just to reassure myself that nothing is forgotten. I still need to buy some underwear, as I’ve recently cleaned out my wardrobe and thrown away raggy/holey clothes.\nIt’s an interesting day today. Today, the 3rd of August, is my sister’s birthday. However, what’s also happening today is my sister is going into labour and will have a baby girl. In the next day or so, I will be an uncle for the first time, a strange feeling resides within me right now.\nThe trip to India is mainly taking place because of my brother. My parents, being the wonderful hippies that they are, have given each one of their children an experience hiking through the Himalayas as a birthday present. My experience was gifted to me when I was 21, in 2012. Back then, I travelled to India with my parents and ventured on a three week expedition through the Zanskar region. This time around we, my parents, brother and I, will do a two week expedition hiking from Zingchem to Zangla, a different valley in the Zansakar region, within the Hemis National Park.\n\n\nFeeling\nBeing “excited” for the trip is an understatement. I’m ecstatic! I can’t wait to be thrown into the midst of uncertainty and chaos. Overloading my senses with strange and new sounds, sights and smells is an addiction. Last year I travelled through Northern Africa and relished in the chaos. My memory of being 21 in India was slightly different. I was probably less confident and comfortable integrating with the crazyness, nevertheless, I loved the trip, and I’m looking forward to seeing how much India has progressed since I was last there.\nIt always interests me to hear the Western world describe “developing” countries as “progressing”. Because, in many ways, I think these countries are already far more progressive than their Western counterparts. The lifestyle within these countries is far more focused on the establishment of relationships. Be that a relationship with family or friends, or a relationship with local small businesses like grocers and butchers. Everything revolves around this structure, which gives life to organic interactions and a stronger feeling of belonging. The only “developing” aspect of these countries is the infrastructure, and by that I mean physical infrastructure, because the digital infrastructure is usually far more agile and advanced than that of New Zealand, for example.\nSo, when I hear someone, particularly as Westerner, describe a country as “developing”, I often wonder if they have thought deeply about that sentiment.\n\n\nWrap Up\nI hope you, whoever you are, follow along with my journey. These are diary entries, meaning I capture whatever thought flows through my mind at the time of writing, with no filter. Other posts will contain photos and descriptions as well."

    "text": "After a twenty hour excursion consisting of two flights and five hour layover in Singapore we touched down in Delhi. I had met Trav (brother) and Mum & Dad at Singapore, where we all had flown from our respective origins. The flights went smoothly, with no delays, cancellations or lost bags. A stark contrast to the usual error riddled modern aviation experience. Singapore Airlines ❤️\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMum & Dad being seasoned travellers, with an expertise travelling specifically in India, had planned most of our six week journey which included pickups from airports. Standing in the Delhi humidity at 7am amongst persistent taxi drivers searching for our driver described to be holding a sign that said “Lal’s Havelli: Eaton” was surprisingly easy. Lal’s Havelli being the name of our accommodation in Pahar Ganj, Delhi. Many dogs, who looked well fed and somewhat healthy/friendly slept on the walkway to the carpark. Our bags were tied to the roof of the car and we set off to the hotel. On the way, we pulled over to cover our bags with a tarpaulin to stave off unpredictable monsoon rains.\nThe hotel was modest. It is built on a lean so climbing the steps and navigating the floors feel like you’re on a deep-sea vessel, or drunk, or both. It’s not a fancy jaunt, but has served well as Mum & Dad’s base into India for decades. After reconvening over chai on the rooftop, we put together a three-day sightseeing plan for Delhi, which consisted of: relax today, Jama Masjid Mosque & Chandni Chowk market tomorrow and Akshardham Mandir (temple) & Connaught Place the following day.\nPahar Ganj is a bustling diverse suburb consisting of local residential areas, small manufacturing (like furniture), restaurants, beggars, middle class wealth and low class poverty. It’s where most back-packers wind up because of the affordable accommodation, food, clothing and products. You can literally find anything here.\n\nJama Masjid\nJama Masjid is a muslim mosque. I visited a lot of mosques last year, so kinda knew what I was in for, and was excited to breathe the devout air that shrouds any mosque. After paratha for breakfast, we snagged a four seater tuktuk for a twenty/thirty minute journey there. It was a simple mosque, but all of them are visually beautiful in their own right, and are cared for by volunteers. We wore pants to cover our knees and ankles. It cost 300 for entry, an extra 50 for mum (all women) for shawl hire, which covers any skin on the neck/face. This was a bit extreme I thought, and was probably just a money grab from the mosque. Shoes had to be removed for entry, and touts tried to flick off slippers for 100, bare feet was fine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJama Masjid\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJama Masjid\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJama Masjid\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJama Masjid\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJama Masjid\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJama Masjid\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJama Masjid\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJama Masjid\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJama Masjid\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJama Masjid\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJama Masjid\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJama Masjid\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJama Masjid\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevoius\n\n\n\nNext\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChandni Chowk\nThe afternoon sun was much more apparent after the mosque, I was sweating and red in the face. A large market area called Chandni Chowk surrounds the mosque. We aimed to make our way towards the clothing area, bypassing the spice market on the way. We followed our noses, which led us through the tools and engineering sector. It was funny to see things like push-lawnmowers and PPE for sale. I can’t imagine the typical Delhi family owning a lawn to tend, and I have yet to see any road workers or labourers wear PPE, let alone covered shoes. It was cute to see small shops selling just one product, probably specialising in it. For example, glue. I entered a glue store asking for super-glue. I need to fix a loose clip on my camera strap. They asked what I needed to glue, I showed them, and we fixed it in the store at no cost. After walking for a while in the industrial area, we realised we were lost. We reconvened and hailed a tuktuk to the spice sector. We arrived. It was chaos! Horns, shouts, cows, traffic at a standstill. Pandemonium. Wandering through the spice was akin to dosing mushrooms. So many colours, smells, people yelling at you, a slight feeling of discomfort but an eager curiosity to be there, to be present in the experience. We stopped for lunch, I can’t remember exactly what we had but it was delicious nonetheless.\nOnwards, to the clothing section. Chaos followed us, or did it spread and we followed it? Kids were running around everywhere, I kept a close eye on my pockets and bag, even moving it to the front of my body to sway pick-pockets. I got some work socks and a nice button up shirt for casual occasions. The main type of garb in the clothing section was woman’s bridal dresses. We all started to fade after a long day in the heat, so we got a tuktuk home. The traffic was bumper to bumper for most the way home, peak traffic! - It was nuts, actually.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChandni Chowk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChandni Chowk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChandni Chowk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChandni Chowk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChandni Chowk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChandni Chowk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChandni Chowk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChandni Chowk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChandni Chowk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChandni Chowk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChandni Chowk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChandni Chowk\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevoius\n\n\n\nNext\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAkshardham Mandir\nAkshardham Mandir is a Hindu temple. After searching for a place to have omelette for breakfast - we vied for something less heavy than southern curry to start the day - we took the metro to the temple. To the metro was busy, pick-pocket territory, I removed everything from my pockets and stored my bag on the front of my body. It was hot walking from the metro to the temple. Security at the temple was insane! First a bag scan for drones, second a declaration of all electronic items including smart watch, phones, camera which had to be remain in your bag and your stored away. Thirdly, a full body scan, pat down and thorough search of pockets. I’m not sure why security was so tight, I have a feeling it has something to do with Hindu nationalism and a disdain for Muslims. But, I’m not exactly sure! Anyway, the temple was stunning! Intricate hard carved walls of sandstone lined the premise, which told a story of Srinirayan Akshardham (a Jesus like figure) and the Hindu journey. Walking the black and white tiles towards the temple drew quite a spectacular view. It’s a shame photography wasn’t allowed. We removed our shoes to enter. Hindu’s were on their knees, some even their stomachs, praying to the idol in the middle. Each load bearing pole resembled a totem with detailed carvings. We walked the interior walls reading and learning about Hinduism. It sounds a bit culty, in my opinion. Regardless, I admire the care for all livings that is embraced within the religion (hence vegetarianism).\nDad was starting to fade from the heat. We coaxed him into walking the base of the temple, where hundreds of elephants were hand carved into the sandstone. We made it, and hurried to find a place for a cold drink before Dad completely melted. The coke was over-priced, but we felt much better afterwards.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAkshardham Mandir\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAkshardham Mandir\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevoius\n\n\n\nNext\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConnaught Place\nAfter Akshardham, we took the metro to Connaught Place. This is the CBD of Delhi, it is of a much different demographic to Pahar Ganj. This is where middle/upper class Indian’s hangout, this is where banks and shopping outlets are. It’s quite a nice design, with a large patch of circular grass in the centre and shopping around it. However, we felt uncomfortable here. Scammers were rife, and came across as educated and for more elaborate than Pahar Ganj scammers. Regardless, they still shared the same persistent, annoying behaviour, the same barrage of words, trying their best to rid you of sensible thought in order to obtain your money in some way or another. Food was priced far beyond our range here, although we found some cheap pastries and hightailed it out of here.\nTrav found a tourist attraction on the map, which was an old, ancient step well. We walked there, it was a beautiful sight, and would have been the beating heart of this area in its heyday (before capitalism). We got two tuktuks home because they wouldn’t allow four of us in one tuktuk. I think this was a decision more for our money, than our safety.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConnaught Place\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevoius\n\n\n\nNext\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThoughts & Feelings\nIndia has changed since I last was here. I remember stopping to drink coke from glass bottles and returning them to the vendor once done, now all drinks are tin cans. There are less beggars and standard of living has generally improved across all facets of life. WiFi is abundant, I remember only accessing internet from internet cafes. Tuktuks are now electric vehicles. And, there is far less cigarette smoking! In fact, I have seen very few people smoking compared to almost every male a decade ago. What hasn’t changed is the constant sales pitch and drive to deliver you Western comfort. I didn’t come to India to experience western things, I don’t want to be comfortable. Instead, I want to feel uncertain, I want to feel out-of-depth and I want to experience things and be stimulated in ways that I cannot back home. It’s a shame that I cut so many people off from conversation because I’m afraid of being scammed. These people may be genuine, but I would rather not take the risk. It’s sad.\nWhat’s funny is, I experienced feelings of “home” after a few hours in Delhi. It makes me wonder, is home really a place, or is home more closely associated with feeling? And, why does my feeling of home differ drastically from the status quo?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMisc\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMisc\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMisc\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMisc\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMisc\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMisc\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMisc\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMisc\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMisc\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMisc\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMisc\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMisc\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMisc\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMisc\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMisc\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevoius\n\n\n\nNext"
