Adventures and events experienced on my six week endeavour exploring the Himalayas in Northern India, are captured as diary entries on this blog. I hope you enjoy reading.

# Details

## Camera

My camera is a Sony Alpha A6400. Usually images are captured using the point and click auto-mode. Sunset images are taken using a preset configuration specifically for sunsets.

The good photos, one that may make you go "wow" were most likely taken by may father. He's a much better photographer than I am.

## Software

For mapping and visualisations I use the programming language **R**, various opensource packages simplify the process of making stunning visuals.

The blog itself is built upon the opensource publishing software: Quarto. Using Quarto allows me to customise the layout in a way that I think captures the imagination of readers and embed images & videos on a page. It also supports, and works in conjunction with R, Python, Julia & Observerable Javascript, meaning it is possible to leverage an impressive array of technologies.

For fine tuning of image layout; such as the image carousels that underlie most paragraphs within a blog post, and embedding sound-bytes, I use HTML. Which is another bonus of using the Quarto framework.
