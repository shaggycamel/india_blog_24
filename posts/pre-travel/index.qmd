# Excursion

I'm writing this one week out from my flight to Delhi.

My bag is packed, although, there is a 100% chance that I will repack it throughout the week, just to reassure myself that nothing is forgotten. I still need to buy some underwear, as I've recently cleaned out my wardrobe and thrown away raggy/holey clothes.

It's an interesting day today. Today, the 3rd of August, is my sister's birthday. However, what's also happening today is my sister is going into labour and will have a baby girl. In the next day or so, I will be an uncle for the first time, a strange feeling resides within me right now.

The trip to India is mainly taking place because of my brother. My parents, being the wonderful hippies that they are, have given each one of their children an experience hiking through the Himalayas as a birthday present. My experience was gifted to me when I was 21, in 2012. Back then, I travelled to India with my parents and ventured on a three week expedition through the Zanskar region. This time around we, my parents, brother and I, will do a two week expedition hiking from Zingchem to Zangla, a different valley in the Zansakar region, within the Hemis National Park.

# Feeling

Being "excited" for the trip is an understatement. I'm ecstatic! I can't wait to be thrown into the midst of uncertainty and chaos. Overloading my senses with strange and new sounds, sights and smells is an addiction. Last year I travelled through Northern Africa and relished in the chaos. My memory of being 21 in India was slightly different. I was probably less confident and comfortable integrating with the crazyness, nevertheless, I loved the trip, and I'm looking forward to seeing how much India has progressed since I was last there.

It always interests me to hear the Western world describe "developing" countries as "progressing". Because, in many ways, I think these countries are already far more progressive than their Western counterparts. The lifestyle within these countries is far more focused on the establishment of relationships. Be that a relationship with family or friends, or a relationship with local small businesses like grocers and butchers. Everything revolves around this structure, which gives life to organic interactions and a stronger feeling of belonging. The only "developing" aspect of these countries is the infrastructure, and by that I mean physical infrastructure, because the digital infrastructure is usually far more agile and advanced than that of New Zealand, for example.

So, when I hear someone, particularly as Westerner, describe a country as "developing", I often wonder if they have thought deeply about that sentiment.

# Wrap Up

I hope you, whoever you are, follow along with my journey. These are diary entries, meaning I capture whatever thought flows through my mind at the time of writing, with no filter. Other posts will contain photos and descriptions as well.
