After a twenty hour excursion consisting of two flights and five hour layover in Singapore we touched down in Delhi. I had met Trav (brother) and Mum & Dad at Singapore, where we all had flown from our respective origins. The flights went smoothly, with no delays, cancellations or lost bags. A stark contrast to the usual error riddled modern aviation experience. Singapore Airlines ❤️

Mum & Dad being seasoned travellers, with an expertise travelling specifically in India, had planned most of our six week journey which included pickups from airports. Standing in the Delhi humidity at 7am amongst persistent taxi drivers searching for our driver described to be holding a sign that said "Lal's Havelli: Eaton" was surprisingly easy. Lal's Havelli being the name of our accommodation in Pahar Ganj, Delhi. Many dogs, who looked well fed and somewhat healthy/friendly slept on the walkway to the carpark. Our bags were tied to the roof of the car and we set off to the hotel. On the way, we pulled over to cover our bags with a tarpaulin to stave off unpredictable monsoon rains.

The hotel was modest. It is built on a lean so climbing the steps and navigating the floors feel like you're on a deep-sea vessel, or drunk, or both. It's not a fancy jaunt, but has served well as Mum & Dad's base into India for decades. After reconvening over chai on the rooftop, we put together a three-day sightseeing plan for Delhi, which consisted of: relax today, Jama Masjid Mosque & Chandni Chowk market tomorrow and Akshardham Mandir (temple) & Connaught Place the following day.

Pahar Ganj is a bustling diverse suburb consisting of local residential areas, small manufacturing (like furniture), restaurants, beggars, middle class wealth and low class poverty. It's where most back-packers wind up because of the affordable accommodation, food, clothing and products. You can literally find anything here.

# Jama Masjid

Jama Masjid is a muslim mosque. I visited a lot of mosques last year, so kinda knew what I was in for, and was excited to breathe the devout air that shrouds any mosque. After paratha for breakfast, we snagged a four seater tuktuk for a twenty/thirty minute journey there. It was a simple mosque, but all of them are visually beautiful in their own right, and are cared for by volunteers. We wore pants to cover our knees and ankles. It cost 300 for entry, an extra 50 for mum (all women) for shawl hire, which covers any skin on the neck/face. This was a bit extreme I thought, and was probably just a money grab from the mosque. Shoes had to be removed for entry, and touts tried to flick off slippers for 100, bare feet was fine.

# Chandni Chowk

The afternoon sun was much more apparent after the mosque, I was sweating and red in the face. A large market area called Chandni Chowk surrounds the mosque. We aimed to make our way towards the clothing area, bypassing the spice market on the way. We followed our noses, which led us through the tools and engineering sector. It was funny to see things like push-lawnmowers and PPE for sale. I can't imagine the typical Delhi family owning a lawn to tend, and I have yet to see any road workers or labourers wear PPE, let alone covered shoes. It was cute to see small shops selling just one product, probably specialising in it. For example, glue. I entered a glue store asking for super-glue. I need to fix a loose clip on my camera strap. They asked what I needed to glue, I showed them, and we fixed it in the store at no cost. After walking for a while in the industrial area, we realised we were lost. We reconvened and hailed a tuktuk to the spice sector. We arrived. It was chaos! Horns, shouts, cows, traffic at a standstill. Pandemonium. Wandering through the spice was akin to dosing mushrooms. So many colours, smells, people yelling at you, a slight feeling of discomfort but an eager curiosity to be there, to be present in the experience. We stopped for lunch, I can't remember exactly what we had but it was delicious nonetheless.

Onwards, to the clothing section. Chaos followed us, or did it spread and we followed it? Kids were running around everywhere, I kept a close eye on my pockets and bag, even moving it to the front of my body to sway pick-pockets. I got some work socks and a nice button up shirt for casual occasions. The main type of garb in the clothing section was woman's bridal dresses. We all started to fade after a long day in the heat, so we got a tuktuk home. The traffic was bumper to bumper for most the way home, peak traffic! - It was nuts, actually.

# Akshardham Mandir

Akshardham Mandir is a Hindu temple. After searching for a place to have omelette for breakfast - we vied for something less heavy than southern curry to start the day - we took the metro to the temple. To the metro was busy, pick-pocket territory, I removed everything from my pockets and stored my bag on the front of my body. It was hot walking from the metro to the temple. Security at the temple was insane! First a bag scan for drones, second a declaration of all electronic items including smart watch, phones, camera which had to be remain in your bag and your stored away. Thirdly, a full body scan, pat down and thorough search of pockets. I'm not sure why security was so tight, I have a feeling it has something to do with Hindu nationalism and a disdain for Muslims. But, I'm not exactly sure! Anyway, the temple was stunning! Intricate hard carved walls of sandstone lined the premise, which told a story of Srinirayan Akshardham (a Jesus like figure) and the Hindu journey. Walking the black and white tiles towards the temple drew quite a spectacular view. It's a shame photography wasn't allowed. We removed our shoes to enter. Hindu's were on their knees, some even their stomachs, praying to the idol in the middle. Each load bearing pole resembled a totem with detailed carvings. We walked the interior walls reading and learning about Hinduism. It sounds a bit culty, in my opinion. Regardless, I admire the care for all livings that is embraced within the religion (hence vegetarianism).

Dad was starting to fade from the heat. We coaxed him into walking the base of the temple, where hundreds of elephants were hand carved into the sandstone. We made it, and hurried to find a place for a cold drink before Dad completely melted. The coke was over-priced, but we felt much better afterwards.

# Connaught Place

After Akshardham, we took the metro to Connaught Place. This is the CBD of Delhi, it is of a much different demographic to Pahar Ganj. This is where middle/upper class Indian's hangout, this is where banks and shopping outlets are. It's quite a nice design, with a large patch of circular grass in the centre and shopping around it. However, we felt uncomfortable here. Scammers were rife, and came across as educated and for more elaborate than Pahar Ganj scammers. Regardless, they still shared the same persistent, annoying behaviour, the same barrage of words, trying their best to rid you of sensible thought in order to obtain your money in some way or another. Food was priced far beyond our range here, although we found some cheap pastries and hightailed it out of here.

Trav found a tourist attraction on the map, which was an old, ancient step well. We walked there, it was a beautiful sight, and would have been the beating heart of this area in its heyday (before capitalism). We got two tuktuks home because they wouldn't allow four of us in one tuktuk. I think this was a decision more for our money, than our safety.

# Thoughts & Feelings

India has changed since I last was here. I remember stopping to drink coke from glass bottles and returning them to the vendor once done, now all drinks are tin cans. There are less beggars and standard of living has generally improved across all facets of life. WiFi is abundant, I remember only accessing internet from internet cafes. Tuktuks are now electric vehicles. Men hold hands less, I vividly remember grown men holding hands to signify friendship, that doesn't happen anymore. And, there is far less cigarette smoking! In fact, I have seen very few people smoking compared to almost every male a decade ago. What hasn't changed is the constant sales pitch and drive to deliver you Western comfort. I didn't come to India to experience western things, I don't want to be comfortable. Instead, I want to feel uncertain, I want to feel out-of-depth and I want to experience things and be stimulated in ways that I cannot back home. It's a shame that I cut so many people off from conversation because I'm afraid of being scammed. These people may be genuine, but I would rather not take the risk. It's sad.

What's funny is, I experienced feelings of "home" after a few hours in Delhi. It makes me wonder, is home really a place, or is home more closely associated with *feeling*? And, why does my feeling of home differ drastically from the status quo?
