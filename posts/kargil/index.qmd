We departed from Srinagar in a car organised by our tour guide at 5am, set for Kargil. It will be just a quick stopover there, consisting of one night.

```{r map}
destinations <- list(
  "Srinagar" = list(label="Srinagar", transport=NA, label_pos="bottom"),
  "Kargil" = list(label="Kargil", transport="car", label_pos="top")
)

plot_route(
  names(destinations),

Kargil is a small Muslim town sandwiched between the Suru river and picturesque mountains.

# Zoji La (pass)

In the first few hours of the drive, we drove over the Zoji La (La means pass). This was our first encounter with altitude. Luckily we were passengers in the vehicle, I wouldn't want to be behind the wheel of a car experiencing a headache and clumsiness bought on by high altitude.

The Zoji La is the second highest pass in the Zanskar region at around 3500 metres. It was cold at the top, and I was really glad to have worn a jacket and have a sweatshirt handy. Warm clothes went against intuition because Srinagar was relatively warm.

# Wander

The small town of Kargil is really cute. There is just one main road and residents are constantly out there going about their business. I'm not sure of the population, but with the amount of people visible, it feels much larger than it probably is.

We stayed in a wonderful hotel with spectacular views of the mountain ranges. Although, a masjid (mosque) was directly next door, so the call to prayer boomed through our windows at 4.30am. Usually I like the call to prayer, it's such a pleasant ambiance, however, on this particular occasion it was so loud and early in the morning that it was annoying.

# Thoughts & Feelings

Kargil is a quaint little town, people are friendly and genuine. Not once did we feel pressured to purchase anything or were followed by beggars or touts. Most just wanted to stop and say hello.

Some interesting signs exclaiming to boycott Israeli products and openly stating that Israeli people were not welcome in Kargil, could be seen dotted around the main street. The Islamic community really have rallied against the Israeli's and the war waged against Palestine. I get it, but your everyday Israeli has no control over what their government does. Most probably disagree with it completely. I haven't met enough Israeli's to formulate a proper opinion about it, but, given the benefit of the doubt, most Israeli's probably aren't that bad. Are they?

Tomorrow we drive eights hours to Leh, in the same car and with the same driver.
