After an early breakfast and our first altitude pill we set off for Leh by car.

```{r map}
destinations <- list(
  "Kargil" = list(label="Kargil", transport=NA, label_pos="bottom"),
  "Leh" = list(label="Leh", transport="car", label_pos="top")
)

It was going to take about six hours to travel 250km. It's slow going because we literally are navigating through the Himalayas and roads are pretty rough. There were a few things we wanted to see on the way, such as a Buddhist Monastery, a Baltistani Fort and the Buddhist town of Lama Yuru. The drive took us more like eight hours because we stopped for lots of photos and exploration on the way, we were all quite tired after arriving in Leh.

# Drive: Kargil to Leh

### Monastery

After a few hours we stopped, I've forgotten the name of the village, it was very small. A large ancient Buddha had been carved into rock by Monks, probably around 400AD. It was quite a stunning sight to behold, as the carving loomed over you, I felt quite small standing underneath it. I was fascinated watching the Buddhists get down on their knees and prey underneath it.

Within the same village, but a short 10-minute drive up a hill on an unpaved road, stood a Buddhist Monastery. We visited it expecting to go inside, but no one was there, so we wandered around the outside, taking in the amazing views of the valley. I felt rather puffed and heavy from the altitude, at one stage I actually doubted whether I could ascend the stairs, which was not a feeling I'd ever felt before.

### Fort

After the Monastery, we continued driving until we came to a turn-off to a village called Chiktan. It's a tiny village with 3/4 houses of devout Muslims. The roads are well-paved and signage from Iranian political leaders is plastered throughout the main street. It appears this town has accepted money/investment from the Iranian government. Much the same way NZ invests in Pacific Island infrastructure, I guess. The Fort, a dilapidated structure from the Baltistan era (600 AD), was perched halfway up a gravel stone hill at the end of the village. We hiked up, again the altitude made my legs feel like lead and I had an annoying headache making the frontal lobe of my brain feel hazy. There were two crumbling structures, Mum and I stopped at the first one and watched Dad and Trav hike further up the hill to the second.

Coming down and getting into the car, we were receiving strange looks from the locals. I got the feeling locals weren't really welcome here, so we got out of the pretty quick. We didn't feel unsafe, rather, encroaching on their private, farming, religious lifestyles.

### Lama Yuru

Our final stop was Lama Yuru, a Buddhist town with a massive monastery, Monks from all over the Himalayas come here, it's quite amazing to see. I've actually been here before, back when I hiked through the Zanskar region with my parents in 2012 (12 years ago). The town is built on a hill and the gradient of the roads reminds me of Wellington.

We didn't go into the Monastery because it had been an arduous day and we still had a few hours drive left to Leh, so we didn't want to spend too long here. Instead of going into the Monastery, we walked around the base of it, taking photos of the amazing views beholden to us.

I strongly remember Lama Yuru back when I was 21, it was the final destination of our three-week hike. And we celebrated by drinking Godfather beer (a high-percentage Indian brew). Mum, Dad & I have seen the interior of the Monastery before, so we didn't feel like we were missing too much this time around. Trav felt indifferent about it, as far as I could tell.

# Leh

We arrived in Leh, which is the largest city in Ladakh with a population of around 130,000 and sits at an altitude of 3500 metres. There is a large military presence here. Again, I've been here before 12 years ago, but it has changed dramatically! Many more tourists are here, the street configuration has changed and the main market is not where it used to be. We spent three nights here, and spent most of our time relaxing and shopping, on our last full day we hiked to a Fort / Monastery poised at the top of a hill near the main centre. The food in Leh is unique, with the main influence coming from Tibet. It was really nice not eating Talhi, Dall and Curry, and instead having Momo (dumpling) or Noodle/Pasta Soup. We also met with our tour guide here and organised details pertaining to our upcoming hike.

### Wander & Shopping

The markets in Leh are such wonderful workshops for locals. Negotiation, barter, deception, networking, wins & losses take place here. As well as the dedicated markets (there are pockets of them all over the city), the streets are lined with dedicated shops that sell much the same goods and products as the markets. The types of things one can buy here are Tibetan jewellery (usually laden with Turquoise), Yak/Pashmina wool products (scarves, shawls, clothing, etc...), all types of clothing, hardware like farming tools, pretty much anything.

The selection of mountaineering clothing for sale is in abundance here, I believe outdoor pursuits are the reason most tourists come here. So, I purchased myself a really nice pair of hiking pants for ₹1500 (\$30 NZD). I also got myself a black corduroy shirt I can wear in casual situations back home, and some jewellery for loved ones. Trav got the purchase of the stay I think, that being a pashmina wool robe that looks like something you can trounce around the house in when working from home. I want one for myself actually, it looks extremely comfortable and warm.

### Fort / Monastery

In the morning we convened in the office of our tour guide, it's a cute one-room office on the outskirts, within walking distance of town, to pick up some permits and discuss the hike a bit more. Afterwards, we continued walking away from town towards the Monastery atop the hill. The walk took about thirty minutes and wasn't too strenuous but the restriction of blood flow through the body due to altitude was apparent.

Views from the Monastery allowed one to see the entire city of Leh, we also watched two Army fighter jets cruise and do laps around nearby mountain ranges. It was really loud but fascinating to watch.

We then walked down the opposite side of the hill to the fort. We didn't go inside because it cost ₹300, which isn't too much, but forts aren't something that greatly interests us. Regardless, it's quite a big structure and would've been a formidable form of defence in the past.

# Thoughts & Feelings

Leh is a really cool city. I actually looked for Data Analyst jobs available, on the off chance that I could live and work here. There were none, haha. I guess the main industry is tourism, in fact, I didn't see any businesses that weren't relevant to tourism in some way (like Banks or Insurance firms).

It's interesting to see the progression and development of a place over such a short time span (12 years). The change is dramatic and makes me wonder why the pace of development in New Zealand is so slow.

Tomorrow we leave for a remote village called Turtuk by car, which is about 8 hours. And we'll pass over the Rotung La, the second-highest navigable pass in the world. After two nights in Turtuk and one in Disket, we return to Leh, which I'm looking forward to. For some reason Leh feels like a place to hunker down; it's easygoing, low pressure, people are nice, the food is good, more expensive than Delhi but relatively cheap in the grand scheme of things, the air is fresh and amazing views are bountiful.

When we return I plan on getting a shave from a barber.
